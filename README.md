This project is a Streamlit-based component library generator for a fitness app. It provides three UI components: a button, a card, and a modal. Each component is displayed with its rendered preview and the corresponding Python code snippet used to create it in Streamlit. The button simulates starting a workout, the card shows a workout summary, and the modal displays additional information with a show/hide toggle.
